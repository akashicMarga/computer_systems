# Computer Systems Exploration

## Overview
This project serves as a personal journey to refresh and deepen understanding of computer systems while simultaneously enhancing skills in C and Rust programming languages. It is designed as a learning project where code implementations and theoretical concepts will be explored and documented.

## Objectives
- To revisit and reinforce fundamental concepts of computer systems.
- To practice and improve programming skills in C and Rust.
- To document the learning process and code implementations for future reference.

## Technologies
- **C Programming Language**: Used for low-level system programming to interact directly with hardware and manipulate memory efficiently.
- **Rust Programming Language**: Employed for safe system-level programming, focusing on ownership, concurrency, and safety.

## Project Structure
- **/c**: Contains all C language related code and examples.
- **/rust**: Houses Rust language implementations and examples.
- **/docs**: Includes documentation and notes on computer systems concepts.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and explore the structured directories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer_systems.git
cd computer_systems
```
